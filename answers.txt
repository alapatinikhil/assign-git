What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A: 
Fast forward means to update the HEAD pointer in such a way that its new value is a direct descendant of the prior value.
A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead the one you have checked-out.
Why should you have different branches?
A:
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others. It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A:
You can have as many remote repositories as you want, but you must give them different names.
